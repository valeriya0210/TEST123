I've spent so much time throwing rocks at your window
НОВАЯ СТРОЧКА
That I never even knocked on the front door
I walk by statues never even made one chip
but if i could leave a mark on the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day
Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honey
